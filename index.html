		<h1>UMD Fall 2020 Course Information</h1>
		<p>This webpage was developed to help students get information about their courses for the upcoming Fall 2020 semester.</p>
		<p>It accesses the information you can see by reading data directly from the University of Maryland's schedule of classes, which you can find <a href="https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/">here</a>.</p>
		<p>All of the information below will be up to date as of the time in the footer down below.</p>
		<p>To search for more relevant information for your courses or department, go <a href="search.html">here</a>.</p>
		<p>All of the code that was used to do this can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ethan-schaffer/UMD-Online-Course-Info">this public GitHub page</a>.</p>
		<p>Please remember that this is a personal project and we aren't affiliated with UMD, so you should double check <a href="https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/">Maryland's schedule of classes</a> before making any major decisions.</p>
