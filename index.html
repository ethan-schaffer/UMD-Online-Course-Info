		<h1>UMD Fall 2020 Course Information</h1>
		<p>This webpage was a project developed to help students get information about their courses for the upcoming Fall 2020 semester. This project is not official, and should not be used as the only source of information a person accesses.</p>
		<p>The data is provided by reading directly from the University of Maryland's schedule of classes, which can be found <a href="https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/">here</a>. The information on this site was last updated as of the time in the footer.</p>
		<p>Please keep in mind that this is a personal project and is not affiliated with UMD. A person should always double-check <a href="https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/">Maryland's schedule of classes</a> before making any major decisions.</p>
